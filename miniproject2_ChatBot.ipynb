    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a model employing ANN on real-world data requires going through several major steps, each of which with \n",
    "important design choices that directly impact the final results. \n",
    "In this project, we guide you through these choices starting from a large database of \n",
    "[conversations](http://parl.ai/downloads/personachat/personachat.tgz) to a functional chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/).\n",
    "- You should know the concepts \"recurrent neural networks\", \"LSTM\", \"training and validation data\", \"overfitting\" and \"early stopping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be guided through a data processing procedure and understand the importance of design choices in ANN modeling\n",
    "- You will learn how to define recurrent neural networks in keras and fit them to data.\n",
    "- You will be guided through a prototyping procedure for the application of deep learning to a specific domain.\n",
    "- You will get in contact with concepts discussed in the lecture, like \"overfitting\", \"LSTM network\", and \"Generative model\".\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night and make sure you save (and load) your data and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answer sentences. \n",
    "We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook. \n",
    "Please ensure that your notebook is fully executed before handing it in. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your notebook through the Moodle page submission tool. You should work in teams of two people and each member should submit the same notebook to Moodle.\n",
